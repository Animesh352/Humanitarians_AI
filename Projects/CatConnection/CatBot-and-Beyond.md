## Abstract

This survey article examines the emerging role of AI-powered chatbots in animal shelter operations, with a particular focus on the CatBot implementation at The Cat Connection. We analyze how these technological solutions address key challenges faced by animal shelters, including resource limitations, adoption barriers for special needs animals, and multilingual community support. Through case studies of successful implementations and examination of best practices, we demonstrate how chatbots can serve as 24/7 digital assistants that enhance volunteer productivity while improving adoption outcomes and community engagement. Recent statistics show approximately 6.5 million animals enter shelters annually with only about 3.2 million being adopted (ASPCA, 2024), highlighting the urgent need for innovative solutions. The article concludes with recommendations for shelters considering chatbot integration and predictions for future developments in this rapidly evolving field.

## 1. Introduction

Animal shelters worldwide face significant operational challenges, from limited staffing resources to communication barriers with diverse community members. According to recent statistics, approximately 6.5 million animals enter U.S. shelters each year, but only about 3.2 million are adopted (The Zebra, 2024). This adoption gap highlights the urgent need for innovative solutions to improve shelter operations and adoption outcomes.

The adoption of artificial intelligence, particularly in the form of specialized chatbots, represents a promising solution to these persistent challenges. These digital assistants can operate continuously, communicate in multiple languages, and free up valuable volunteer time for direct animal care while simultaneously addressing common adoption barriers. Research indicates that implementing AI solutions in customer service contexts can save organizations up to 30% in support costs (Tidio, 2024), suggesting similar potential for resource-limited animal shelters.

The CatBot implementation at The Cat Connection shelter exemplifies this innovative approach. Developed by Northeastern University students Tanvie Sud, Shreyaan Pathak, Laasya Anantha Prasad, Siddharth Dumbre, and Nicholas Brown through the D'Amore-McKim School of Business AI Strategic Hub (DASH) under the guidance of Dr. Kwong Chan and Dr. Debashish Ghose, CatBot specifically targets the adoption of senior and special needs cats—animals that typically face longer shelter stays and lower adoption rates. By providing personalized information, addressing misconceptions, and facilitating matches between cats and potential adopters, CatBot demonstrates the potential of AI to create meaningful social impact in animal welfare.

This article surveys the current landscape of chatbot implementations in animal shelters, examining both the technical features and the measured outcomes of these digital assistants. We explore how chatbots can overcome language barriers, operate continuously, and ultimately allow human volunteers to focus their limited time on high-value interactions that require empathy and personal connection.
