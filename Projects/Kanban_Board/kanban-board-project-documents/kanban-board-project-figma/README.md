[View Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/wG3RwuLFrXISO5Dee41aDc/OPT---Kanban-Design?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=t6i6zz37W5XMmoyH-0)

We have designed and implemented three core user flows within the Kanban Board system, each with a recorded demo:

- **Admin Kanban Flow** – Board management, user roles, and permission control  
- **Project Manager (PM) Kanban Flow** – Sprint planning, task delegation, and progress tracking  
- **Volunteer Kanban Flow** – Task updates, contribution tracking, and collaboration interface  

Demo videos are hosted separately and can be shared upon request or via the project deliverables folder.
