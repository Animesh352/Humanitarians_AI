We have designed and implemented three core user flows within the Kanban Board system, each with a recorded demo:


- **[Admin Kanban Flow](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11V6_qcCGawr_gjUxdIlEBIRHR-y_nXRR/view?usp=sharing)** – Board management, user roles, and permission control  
- **[Project Manager (PM) Kanban Flow](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rJV1LTtE3YtE-9_lFYp2PBUNeo7lhZj-/view?usp=sharing)** – Sprint planning, task delegation, and progress tracking  
- **[Volunteer Kanban Flow](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q74YC5Rq5NJnia4a2-Jar5dXQ7q-Jm1-/view?usp=sharing)** – Task updates, contribution tracking, and collaboration interface  
 

Demo videos are hosted separately and can be shared upon request or via the project deliverables folder.

**Upcoming:** Mobile screen designs are currently in development to ensure a responsive and accessible experience across all devices.
