# Biweekly Report 5
**Name:** Sangeet Saha  
**Date Range:** March 17 – March 30  
**Team/Project Name:** Solution Merger – Super Agent Architecture v2

## Hours
Total hours this period: 80

## Highlights
- Completed and tested the DocumentChunker module with support for multiple formats (PDF, TXT) and chunk sizes, storing chunks in ChromaDB.
- Finalized the RelevanceScorer with a dual-stage ranking system: initial vector similarity filtering + cross-encoder reranking for top-k precision.
- Implemented ContentSynthesizer to intelligently merge solutions using token-aware logic and redundancy detection via semantic similarity.
- Created ReportGenerator that generates structured JSON and Markdown reports, includes metadata tracking, summaries, and extracted content sections.
- Built a CLI and programmatic interface in main.py to orchestrate the entire workflow end-to-end.
- System handles over 100k tokens worth of data efficiently and outputs within token limits.
- Final documentation written with usage instructions, configuration details, diagrams, and modular examples.

## In Progress
- Refining configuration objects for agents and LLMs to dynamically adjust synthesis behavior.
- Expanding test suite for regression testing and edge cases.
- Writing integration tests to validate performance with long documents and multi-agent pipelines.

## Next Steps
- Add support for HTML and JSON as input formats.
- Package the system for internal deployment with API endpoints.
- Connect the output of this pipeline to downstream Super Agent workflow.
- Prepare a walkthrough video and code demo for external teams.
- Seek feedback from end-users to further improve output structure and synthesis quality.

## Team Interactions
### Wednesday Standups (9:00 AM):
- **Discussion Summary:** Shared final synthesis and report generation implementation. Discussed token budgeting and summarization thresholds.
- **Feedback:** Team appreciated the modular design and clarity of outputs; suggested exploring richer summarization strategies.
- **Demo Shared:** Full system demo from input ingestion to JSON+Markdown report generation.

### Friday Standups (9:00 AM):
- **Discussion Summary:** Reviewed testing plans and configuration flexibility.
- **Feedback:** Positive feedback on the architecture's adaptability for multi-agent use cases.
- **Demo Shared:** Command-line usage demo and preview of executive summary output.

### Other Meetings/Collaborations:
- March 20: Team sync on report formatting and metadata standardization
- March 26: Feedback session with project lead on final documentation and usability

## Learnings & Reflections
- Gained deep experience designing and scaling modular NLP pipelines with token-sensitive synthesis logic.
- Improved understanding of semantic similarity-based redundancy detection and dynamic summarization techniques.
- Refined documentation skills to create developer-friendly, production-ready technical reports.

## Blockers
- Token limit enforcement varies by LLM — required fine-tuning synthesis behavior to avoid truncation.
- Some reranker models had inconsistent results depending on input phrasing — mitigated by normalizing chunks and queries.
