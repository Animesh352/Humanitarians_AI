# Biweekly Report 1
**Name:** Sangeet Saha  
**Date Range:** January 20 â€“ February 2  
**Team/Project Name:** Chain of Thought Multi-Agent Reasoning (Humanitarian AI)

## Hours
Total hours this period: 80

## Highlights
- Successfully completed all onboarding procedures including GitHub organization access.
- Set up core development environment with required software and Python libraries.
- Installed and tested Ollama locally for LLM experimentation and inference benchmarking.
- Conducted successful endpoint tests with LLaMA 3.2 models using Ollama CLI and REST APIs.
- Explored LangFlow, developed a basic flow to understand node-based workflows for chaining LLM calls.
- Participated in multiple project scoping meetings to understand the vision, technical requirements, and resource availability.
- Expressed interest in building chain-of-thought (CoT) agents, contributing ideas toward modular AI workflows.

## In Progress
- Deepening understanding of LLM frameworks like Ollama and LangFlow.
- Exploring initial design decisions around agent collaboration, multi-model usage, and reasoning steps.
- Familiarizing with existing internal projects and evaluating alignment with personal expertise.

## Next Steps
- Begin active development on the chain-of-thought multi-agent architecture.
- Start building frontend prototypes using Gradio for interactive AI demos.
- Continue evaluating open-source LLMs for local vs hosted inference.

## Team Interactions
### Wednesday Standups (9:00 AM):
- **Discussion Summary:** Introduced myself and shared environment setup status.
- **Feedback:** Encouraged to explore multiple projects and choose what aligns with interests.
- **Demo Shared:** Basic LangFlow test shared informally.

### Friday Standups (9:00 AM):
- **Discussion Summary:** Shared updates on testing Ollama and LangFlow exploration.
- **Feedback:** Suggested to begin exploring agent-based system designs.
- **Demo Shared:** None.

### Other Meetings/Collaborations:
- Jan 23: Onboarding sync with core contributors; walked through project goals and roles.
- Jan 26: AI system design brainstorming; introduced high-level ideas around task decomposition and reasoning.

## Learnings & Reflections
- Learned how different open-source LLMs differ in API behavior and performance.
- Understood the importance of system design discussions even in early-stage open-source projects.
- Recognized the value of agent modularity for scaling AI workflows.

## Blockers
- Minor network configuration issues when accessing Ollama API.
- Initial learning curve with LangFlow UI and DSL (Domain-Specific Language).
