# Biweekly Report 4
**Name:** Sangeet Saha  
**Date Range:** March 3 – March 16  
**Team/Project Name:** Solution Merger – Super Agent Architecture v2

## Hours
Total hours this period: 80

## Highlights
- Participated in detailed discussions about the project scope and architectural requirements of the Solution Merger module for large-scale LLM pipelines.
- Designed a modular, extensible system with individual components: DocumentChunker, RelevanceScorer, ContentSynthesizer, ReportGenerator, and SolutionMerger controller.
- Outlined technical responsibilities and integration plans for document ingestion, retrieval, ranking, synthesis, and reporting.
- Initiated development work after system design approvals.
- Conducted in-depth research and evaluation of available libraries for chunking (PyMuPDF, PDFplumber, LangChain), vector storage (ChromaDB, FAISS), and scoring (transformers-based cross-encoders).
- Established baseline repository structure, configuration interfaces, and utility functions.
- Drafted and presented the initial architecture diagram and documented workflow using Markdown and diagrams.net.

## In Progress
- Implementing the DocumentChunker and RelevanceScorer modules with flexibility for various file types and vector stores.
- Testing integration between chunking logic and embedding pipelines.
- Benchmarking various reranking models including sentence-transformers and cross-encoders for relevance-based chunk reranking.
- Laying groundwork for pipeline orchestration and modular testing.

## Next Steps
- Finalize and test relevance scoring system with dual-stage selection and reranking.
- Begin integration of the synthesis and report generation modules.
- Create sample test cases to evaluate the effectiveness of merging logic.
- Optimize token budget usage across synthesis to stay within LLM token limits.
- Draft system prompt templates for different merging behaviors.

## Team Interactions
### Wednesday Standups (9:00 AM):
- **Discussion Summary:** Reviewed progress on system architecture, discussed model options for relevance scoring and synthesis, highlighted data flow and interaction points.
- **Feedback:** Design was well-received, with suggestions to make modules reusable for other super-agent pipelines.
- **Demo Shared:** Walkthrough of the architecture diagram and GitHub repository setup.

### Friday Standups (9:00 AM):
- **Discussion Summary:** Shared progress on chunking and reranking prototypes. Discussed implementation trade-offs in scoring methods.
- **Feedback:** Suggested to prioritize support for large document handling and reusability of components.
- **Demo Shared:** Mini demo of chunking pipeline and similarity scoring.

### Other Meetings/Collaborations:
- March 6: 1:1 discussion with teammate to clarify token limits and system constraints
- March 11: Architecture validation and peer review session

## Learnings & Reflections
- Learned about cross-encoder reranking mechanisms and their role in improving RAG output precision.
- Gained insight into architectural tradeoffs in building modular NLP pipelines versus monolithic implementations.
- Developed strong familiarity with managing document chunks, semantic search, and token-efficient design for LLM usage.

## Blockers
- Difficulty choosing the right scoring model that balances latency and accuracy. Still comparing fast Bi-Encoders vs accurate Cross-Encoders.
- Need for performance benchmarking tools to test token-size limits and response quality across LLMs.
