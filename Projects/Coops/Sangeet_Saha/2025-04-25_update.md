**Name:** Sangeet Saha  
**Date Range:** April 14 – April 25  
**Team/Project Name:** The God Machine & Solution Merger

## Hours
Total hours this period: 80

## Highlights
- Finalized reasoning prompt templates after extensive testing cycles with The God Machine's agents.
- Documented design decisions, agent behavior patterns, and interaction formats to ensure clarity for future team members.
- Contributed back to the Solution Merger project by updating the ContentSynthesizer and ReportGenerator modules for more contextual integration with multi-agent systems.
- Polished and cleaned up the report generation logic to handle agent-generated content while preserving formatting and token discipline.
- Began working on comprehensive documentation across all recent projects including God Machine and Solution Merger.
- Compiled weekly summaries and began drafting the final consolidated report.

## In Progress
- Organizing folder structures and code comments across projects for easier handoff.
- Creating visual diagrams for system workflows and agent interactions.

## Next Steps
- Complete and submit the final project documentation.
- Deliver a combined report summarizing the architectural approaches, agent logic, synthesis methods, and challenges across both projects.
- Prepare optional handover demo materials and diagrams.

## Team Interactions
- April 17: Final feedback session on prompt templates and agent reasoning.
- April 19: Integration check-in with Solution Merger team.
- April 22: Doc review and internal walkthrough with team leads.

## Learnings & Reflections
- Learned how to generalize prompt structures to work across many agent types without overfitting.
- Improved ability to merge insights from multiple projects into a single coherent documentation narrative.
- Realized the value of modular thinking and clean handoff strategies in fast-moving multi-agent research teams.

## Blockers
- Minimal—just coordinating final formatting across documentation standards and syncing all project components for final submission.
