# Biweekly Report 6
**Name:** Sangeet Saha  
**Date Range:** March 31 – April 13  
**Team/Project Name:** The God Machine (Reasoning Subsystem) & Solution Merger

## Hours
Total hours this period: 80

## Highlights
- Joined the new project The God Machine, which involves a sophisticated infrastructure of fine-tuned agents collaborating to solve complex problems.
- Took ownership of designing and building the reasoning module for the agents—critical for coordinating thought chains and structured problem-solving.
- Worked on modeling agent interactions, focusing on logical flows, consistency, and seamless communication between agents in the network.
- Began creating structured system prompts to guide each agent's reasoning steps depending on task complexity and dependencies.
- Ran internal evaluations to validate agent responses across problem types (analytical, abstract, fact-based), tuning prompts iteratively for clarity and performance.

## In Progress
- Refining interaction protocols among agents to improve coherence and reduce circular reasoning.
- Expanding the prompt library to handle diverse reasoning formats and dynamic context windows.
- Collaborating with other module owners to align agent behavior with upstream and downstream tasks.

## Next Steps
- Finalize system prompt templates and run stress tests on large-scale agent coordination.
- Update internal docs to reflect current prompt structure and expected behavior for reasoning agents.
- Continue working with the Solution Merger team to update synthesis and report-generation features based on new agent outputs.

## Team Interactions
- April 3: Project onboarding and architecture deep-dive.
- April 5 & 10: Reasoning syncs with lead developers and prompt engineers.
- April 12: Group review on agent behavior across test problems.

## Learnings & Reflections
- Gained insight into distributed agent design, particularly with dynamic LLM reasoning coordination.
- Learned how structured prompts can scale across multi-agent settings while preserving reasoning depth.
- Reinforced prompt engineering best practices and fast iteration with real-time feedback loops.

## Blockers
- Prompt inconsistency when agents were presented with ambiguous input—working on improving fallback strategies and clarification mechanisms.
