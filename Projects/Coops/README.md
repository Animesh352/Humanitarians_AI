# Humanitarians AI Co-op Program

## Welcome to the Humanitarians AI Co-op Program!

This document outlines the requirements and expectations for all Northeastern University students participating in co-op with Humanitarians AI. Following these guidelines is mandatory for successful completion of your co-op experience and receiving appropriate evaluation and credit.

## Questions or Support

If you have any questions about these requirements or need assistance with GitHub, please contact us at: **hr.aihumanitarians@gmail.com**

## Getting Started

1. **Project Selection**: 
   - Review available projects at [Humanitarians AI GitHub](https://github.com/nikbearbrown/Humanitarians_AI)
   - Select a project that matches your interests and skills
   - Work with your supervisor to define project scope and deliverables

2. **GitHub Setup (REQUIRED)**:
   - Each co-op student MUST add themselves as a collaborator on their project's GitHub repository
   - You must use your personal GitHub account that clearly identifies you
   - If you're new to GitHub, please familiarize yourself with basic Git operations (commit, push, pull, etc.)

3. **Co-ops Directory Setup**:
   - After being added as a collaborator, create your personal folder within the "Coops" directory
   - Name the folder using the format: `Firstname_Lastname`
   - Create a profile README.md in your folder with:
     - Your name and contact information
     - Professional background/skills
     - Project role/responsibilities
     - Co-op start date
     - Co-op end date

## Documentation Requirements

### Bi-Weekly Updates (MANDATORY)

All co-op students MUST provide updates at minimum every two weeks. This is non-negotiable and essential for maintaining active status in the program.

Your bi-weekly updates should:

1. Be committed directly to your personal folder in the Coops directory
2. Use the following naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_update.md`
3. Include:
   - Summary of work completed in the past two weeks
   - Challenges encountered and how they were addressed
   - Goals for the next two weeks
   - Any resources or assistance needed
   - Hours contributed during this period

### Final Report (MANDATORY)

All co-op students MUST submit a final report before their end date. This report is a critical component of your evaluation and is required by both Humanitarians AI and Northeastern University.

Your final report should:

1. Be committed to your personal folder in the Coops directory
2. Use the filename: `Final_Report.md` (or .pdf)
3. Include:
   - Executive summary of your project
   - Detailed description of your contributions
   - Technical documentation of your work
   - Challenges faced and solutions implemented
   - Results and impact of your project
   - Skills acquired and professional growth
   - Recommendations for future work

### Project Documentation

Beyond your personal updates and final report, you should contribute to the project's main documentation as appropriate:

- Add a description of your project to the main README.md
- Create thorough code comments
- Develop function/module documentation
- Write user guides if applicable
- Document technical specifications
- Record research findings

## Tracking and Evaluation

The GitHub-based tracking system provides an objective basis for evaluating your contributions. The following metrics will be considered when assessing your work:

- Frequency and quality of commits
- Consistency of bi-weekly updates
- Completion of your final report
- Contributions to project milestones
- Collaboration with other team members
- Quality and impact of work produced

## Co-op Completion and Verification

### Co-op Evaluation
Your co-op evaluation will be based on:
1. Active participation throughout the entire co-op period
2. Maintenance of regular bi-weekly updates
3. Submission of a comprehensive final report
4. Substantial, verifiable contributions to your assigned project
5. Proper documentation of all work following the guidelines above

### Important Verification Notes

**IMPORTANT:** These documentation requirements are essential for your co-op verification:

- Active participation must be continuously documented through GitHub
- If you stop making bi-weekly updates, we will assume you left the program on the date of your last update
- Even if you continue working but fail to document it, we cannot verify participation beyond your last documented update
- Co-op verification letters will only reflect the dates and contributions that are properly documented in GitHub
- It is your responsibility to maintain an accurate record of your involvement through regular commits and updates

This policy exists to ensure integrity and accuracy in our official verifications. Humanitarians AI can only verify what is objectively documented in our systems.

## Intellectual Property Reminder

All co-op students should remember that they have signed agreements containing the following language:

> *Volunteer will, upon request of Humanitarians AI, without any additional consideration, promptly execute and deliver any and all documents or instruments and take any other action which Humanitarians AI shall deem necessary to assign to and vest completely in Humanitarians AI the Developments, to perfect trademark, copyright and patent protection with respect thereto, or to otherwise protect Humanitarians AI's trade secrets and proprietary interest in the Developments. Unless so requested or otherwise permitted in writing by Humanitarians AI, Volunteer will not apply for any patents or copyrights, whether domestic or foreign, on all or any portion of the Developments.*
> 
> *By execution of this Agreement, Volunteer irrevocably constitutes and appoints Humanitarians AI and its executive officers, with full power of substitution, to be its true and lawful attorney, in its name, place and stead, to execute, acknowledge, swear to and file all instruments, conveyances, certificates, agreements and other documents, and to take any action which will be necessary, appropriate or desirable to effectuate the foregoing provisions regarding assigning, securing, protecting or registering property rights in the Developments. The powers of attorney granted herein will be deemed to be coupled with an interest and will be irrevocable and survive the occurrence of the death or incapacity of Volunteer.*

## Important Reminders

- **All significant work MUST be documented through GitHub** - if it's not on GitHub, it didn't happen
- **Bi-weekly updates are mandatory** - missing updates may affect your co-op evaluation
- **Final report is required** - this is essential for co-op completion
- **Public repositories** - remember that your work is publicly visible; follow best practices for security and privacy
- **Code of conduct** - all participants must adhere to our code of conduct (see project main page)

## Community Engagement and Social Media

### Supporting the Humanitarians AI Community

Active engagement with the Humanitarians AI community is highly valued and considered when evaluating co-op students' commitment to our mission. Co-op students are strongly encouraged to follow and engage with our official social media channels:

- **LinkedIn**: [Humanitarians AI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/105696953/)
- **SoundCloud**: [Humanitarians AI](https://soundcloud.com/humanitarians-ai)
- **Spotify**: [Humanitarians AI](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3cj3R4pDpYQHaWx0MM2vFV)
- **Apple Music**: [Humanitarians AI](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/humanitarians-ai/1781414009)

  **Please Star the Github repo that your project is in**

### Engagement Expectations

When evaluating co-op performance, we consider:

1. **Regular Engagement**: Following our social channels and engaging with posts
2. **Content Sharing**: Resharing Humanitarians AI content with your professional network
3. **Thoughtful Interaction**: Commenting on and supporting other colleagues' achievements
4. **Community Ambassadorship**: Representing our mission in your professional communications

### Why Community Engagement Matters

Your engagement with our content and community demonstrates:
- Commitment to our shared mission beyond individual project work
- Support for the broader Humanitarians AI ecosystem
- Willingness to help expand our impact and reach
- Investment in the community's collective success

**Important Note**: While social media engagement is considered as a positive factor when evaluating co-op performance, it complements but does not replace the mandatory GitHub documentation requirements outlined in this document. Proper documentation of your work remains the primary requirement for program participation and verification.

By following these guidelines, you'll not only create a valuable record of your contributions but also develop professional skills in documentation, collaboration, and project management that will benefit your future career.
