# Humanitarians AI Fellows Program

## Welcome to the Humanitarians AI Fellows Program!

This document outlines the requirements and expectations for all volunteers participating in Humanitarians AI projects. Following these guidelines is mandatory for receiving recommendation letters and acknowledgment of your contributions.

## Getting Started

1. **Project Selection**: 
   - Review available projects at [Humanitarians AI GitHub](https://github.com/nikbearbrown/Humanitarians_AI)
   - Select a project that matches your interests and skills
   - Reach out to the project lead to express interest

2. **GitHub Setup (REQUIRED)**:
   - Each volunteer MUST add themselves as a collaborator on their chosen project's GitHub repository
   - You must use a GitHub account that clearly identifies you
   - If you're new to GitHub, please familiarize yourself with basic Git operations (commit, push, pull, etc.)

3. **Fellows Directory Setup**:
   - After being added as a collaborator, create your personal folder within the "Fellows" directory
   - Name the folder using the format: `Firstname_Lastname`
   - Create a profile README.md in your folder with:
     - Your name and contact information
     - Professional background/skills
     - Project role/interests
     - Start date with Humanitarians AI
     - Expected end date or duration of commitment

## Documentation Requirements

### Bi-Weekly Updates (MANDATORY)

All fellows MUST provide updates at minimum every two weeks. This is non-negotiable and essential for maintaining active status in the program.

Your bi-weekly updates should:

1. Be committed directly to your personal folder in the Fellows directory
2. Use the following naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_update.md`
3. Include:
   - Summary of work completed in the past two weeks
   - Challenges encountered and how they were addressed
   - Goals for the next two weeks
   - Any resources or assistance needed
   - Hours contributed during this period

### Project Documentation

Beyond your personal updates, you should contribute to the project's main documentation as appropriate:

- Code comments
- Function/module documentation
- User guides
- Technical specifications
- Research findings

## Tracking and Evaluation

The GitHub-based tracking system provides an objective basis for evaluating your contributions. The following metrics will be considered when assessing your work:

- Frequency and quality of commits
- Consistency of bi-weekly updates
- Contributions to project milestones
- Collaboration with other team members
- Quality and impact of work produced

## Recommendation Letters

Recommendation letters will only be issued to fellows who:

1. Have been active contributors for a minimum duration (typically 2-3 months)
2. Have maintained regular bi-weekly updates throughout their involvement
3. Have made substantial, verifiable contributions to their project
4. Have properly documented their work following the guidelines above

## Entrepreneurship Track

For those interested in the entrepreneurship aspects of our projects:

- Regular team meetings will be held to discuss entrepreneurial opportunities
- Business model development will be tracked through the same GitHub system
- Market research, customer development, and business planning should be documented in your updates

## Communication

While much of our work happens asynchronously through GitHub, we also maintain:

- Regular team meetings (schedule will be shared separately)
- Slack/Discord channels for day-to-day communication
- Email updates for major announcements

## Important Reminders

- **All significant work MUST be documented through GitHub** - if it's not on GitHub, it didn't happen
- **Bi-weekly updates are mandatory** - missing updates may result in removal from the program
- **Public repositories** - remember that your work is publicly visible; follow best practices for security and privacy
- **Code of conduct** - all participants must adhere to our code of conduct (see project main page)

By following these guidelines, you'll not only create a valuable record of your contributions but also develop professional skills in documentation, collaboration, and project management that will benefit your future career.

## Questions?

If you have any questions about these requirements or need assistance with GitHub, please contact the project leads or program administrators.
