*This diagram contrasts the traditional consumer journey with the emerging AI-mediated journey, highlighting how AI is inserting itself between brands and consumers at critical decision points.*

## Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, brands are facing a paradigm shift in how they market their products and services. As artificial intelligence increasingly mediates consumer choices—from product recommendations to travel planning—businesses are discovering that AI systems may be their most critical audience. According to Boston Consulting Group research, 28% of consumers already use AI to recommend products like cosmetics, and the trend is accelerating with the development of AI agents that can make purchases directly on behalf of users.

This phenomenon represents a supercharged version of search engine optimization (SEO), where ensuring positive perception by large language models (LLMs) could become crucial for a brand's success. This article explores how companies are navigating this new terrain, the tools and strategies they're developing, and the ethical considerations emerging in this AI-mediated marketplace.

## The Rise of AI as a Customer Gatekeeper

**Suggested Visualization: A flowchart showing how AI forms perceptions of brands**
```
[Brand Digital Assets] → [AI Training Data] → [AI Interpretation] → [Consumer Recommendation]
```
*This flowchart illustrates how brand content becomes part of AI training data, which informs AI interpretation, ultimately affecting consumer recommendations.*

### How AI Systems Perceive Brands

AI systems form "opinions" about brands based on the data they've been trained on. These perceptions can significantly influence consumer choices when people rely on AI for recommendations. In one real-world example highlighted by Jack Smyth of JellyFish, a meal prep company was described by ChatGPT as "complicated and confusing" simply because the AI observed chopped chives in promotional images and determined this would be off-putting to potential customers seeking simplicity.

Unlike human perceptions, which develop over time through personal experience and can be influenced by emotions, AI perceptions are formed through pattern recognition across vast datasets. This means that every piece of content a brand has ever published online—from advertisements to social media posts to product descriptions—contributes to how AI systems understand and represent that brand.

**Suggested Visualization: Comparison table of AI brand perception vs. intended brand positioning**
```
| Brand | Intended Positioning | AI Model Perception | Misalignment |
|-------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| Meal Prep Co. | Simple & Easy | Complicated & Confusing | Chopped herbs in imagery interpreted as complexity |
| Ballantine's | Mass Market Product | Prestige Product | Confusion with premium product line |
| Brand X | Sustainable | No sustainability mention | Green initiatives not prominent in digital assets |
```
*This table illustrates how brands' intended positioning can misalign with AI perceptions, with examples of actual misalignments discovered by brands.*

### Case Study: Ballantine's Whisky

Pernod Ricard, which owns Ballantine's Scotch whisky, discovered that Meta's Llama model was incorrectly identifying their mass-market product as a prestige offering. This mischaracterization occurred because Ballantine's also produces a premium line, causing confusion in the AI's understanding.

In response, Gokcen Karaca, head of digital and design at Pernod Ricard, directed his team to create new assets for social media that emphasized the product's universal appeal. While results are still being evaluated, Karaca reports that early indicators show positive movement toward correcting the AI's perception.

This case illustrates how brands must now consider not just how humans perceive their messaging, but how AI systems interpret and categorize it—even when those systems make mistakes that seem obvious to human observers.

## Measuring and Influencing AI Perception

*This radar chart concept shows how different AI models might score the same brand on multiple dimensions, highlighting perception variations across models.*

### Tools for AI Perception Analysis

Companies are developing specialized tools to analyze how various AI models perceive their brands. One example is "Share of Model," created by JellyFish (part of the Brandtech Group), which assesses brand perception across different AI platforms.

The tool functions similarly to a human survey but with LLMs as respondents. It poses numerous questions about a brand to different models and analyzes the responses to identify trends. This approach reveals how perceptions can vary between models—for instance, Meta's Llama might view a brand as both exciting and reliable, while OpenAI's ChatGPT might perceive it as exciting but not necessarily reliable.

*This process diagram illustrates the cyclical approach brands can take to manage their AI perception.*

### Strategies for Influencing AI Perception

While the science of influencing AI perception is still emerging, several approaches show promise:

1. **Content Strategy Alignment**: Ensuring consistent messaging across all digital channels to reinforce desired brand associations
2. **Model-Specific Optimization**: Tailoring content to address how specific AI models perceive a brand
3. **Chain-of-Thought Analysis**: Studying reasoning models to understand the decision process that leads to brand recommendations

The advent of reasoning models that explain their thought processes provides new opportunities for brands to understand AI recommendation mechanics. By examining the "chain of thought" that leads a model to recommend a particular product, marketers can identify which attributes hold the most weight in AI decision-making.

                                         │ Product Z: 0%
                                         │
Prompt B: "...user-friendly controls,    │ Product X: 0%

                                         │ Product Z: █████████ 90%
                                         │
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
```
*This horizontal bar chart shows how different wording in prompts dramatically shifts which products are recommended by AI systems.*

### Case Study: Prompt Engineering Research

Research from Carnegie Mellon University has demonstrated that even minor changes in prompt wording can dramatically influence AI product recommendations. In one experiment, researchers found that altering a prompt about pressure cookers from focusing on "cooking performance" to emphasizing "user-friendly controls" and "digital displays" shifted one model's recommendation rate for Instant Pot from 0% to 100%.

This finding suggests that brands may soon attempt to influence recommended prompts in online forums where users share AI query templates. Researchers warn that consumers should be cautious about using third-party prompts, as they may be designed to manipulate AI responses toward specific brand recommendations.

*This timeline illustrates the likely evolution of the relationship between brands and AI platforms, from basic optimization to collaborative approaches.*

### The Cat-and-Mouse Game

The relationship between AI companies and brands is evolving into a dynamic similar to the one that has existed between search engines and SEO practitioners for decades. As brands develop techniques to influence AI perceptions, AI developers implement countermeasures to ensure their systems provide unbiased, relevant recommendations.

Jack Smyth of JellyFish describes this as a "cat-and-mouse game" where overtly manipulative tactics are unlikely to succeed in the long term. While some brands may attempt to use tactics like prompt injection or embedding biased messaging in seemingly innocent content, AI platforms are likely to develop methods to identify and neutralize such approaches.

**Suggested Visualization: Table of detected AI biases in brand recommendations**
```
| Category of Bias       | Example                                   | Potential Impact                        |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Global vs. Local Brands| Global brands described more positively   | Disadvantages local businesses          |
| Geographic Bias        | Different recommendations by country      | Reinforces economic disparities         |
| Price Point Bias       | Premium brands get more detailed coverage | Skews market toward luxury offerings    |
| Category Familiarity   | Better-known categories described better  | Hampers innovation in niche markets     |
| Data Recency           | Newer brands underrepresented             | Creates barrier to entry for startups   |
```
*This table categorizes types of biases observed in AI brand recommendations and their potential market impacts.*

### Ethical Considerations and Bias

Research from the University of South Florida has identified concerning biases in how AI models evaluate brands. These systems tend to view global brands more favorably than local alternatives, describing international companies like Nike as "fashionable" or "comfortable" while characterizing local competitors as "poor quality" or "uncomfortable."

The study also found that when prompted to recommend gifts for people in high-income countries, AI systems suggest luxury brands, whereas for low-income countries, they recommend non-luxury options. These inherent biases raise ethical questions about relying on AI for product recommendations and the potential reinforcement of existing market inequalities.

*This comparison highlights the differences between traditional human focus groups and AI testing approaches, including cost, speed, and capabilities.*

### Leveraging AI for Market Testing

Beyond their role as customer gatekeepers, AI systems can serve as sophisticated focus groups for brands. Before launching new campaigns, companies can use AI to evaluate marketing concepts from various demographic perspectives.

As Smyth notes, some clients use what they call a "gen-AI gut check" to test different marketing approaches before committing resources to campaign development. This allows brands to quickly assess potential consumer reactions to multiple concepts without the time and expense of traditional focus group testing.

*This quadrant diagram illustrates how brand consistency correlates with likelihood of AI recommendation. Consistent brands (Quadrant A) are more likely to be recommended by AI systems than inconsistent brands (Quadrant B).*

### The Growing Importance of Brand Consistency

With AI systems analyzing all available content related to a brand, consistency in messaging has become more critical than ever. Rebecca Sykes of Brandtech Group emphasizes that brands appearing differently across various platforms create confusion for AI models, making it difficult for them to form clear recommendations.

This challenge is particularly acute for brands with diverse product lines or those that have undergone significant rebranding efforts. Companies must now consider how their entire digital footprint—past and present—shapes AI understanding of their brand identity.

*This timeline shows the evolution of priority audiences for marketers, with AI systems potentially becoming the primary audience that brands must satisfy.*

The emergence of AI as a critical audience for brands represents a fundamental shift in the marketing landscape. Companies that proactively address how AI systems perceive and represent their products will gain competitive advantage in this new environment. However, this transition also raises important questions about transparency, bias, and the ethical boundaries of AI influence.

As Rebecca Sykes of Brandtech Group observes, we are "probably at the very beginning of the conversations that most brands are having, where they're even thinking about AI as a new audience." The brands that recognize and adapt to this reality earliest will be best positioned to thrive in the AI-mediated marketplace of the future.
